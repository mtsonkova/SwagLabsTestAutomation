A simple test automation project of manual test cases for Swag Labs app available on https://www.saucedemo.com/.

The manual test cases are available on the following git repo: https://github.com/mtsonkova/Manual-Test-Cases/tree/main/SwagLabs%20Manual%20Test%20Cases.

Test automation pending as a blocker is encountered on the CheckoutOverivew page https://www.saucedemo.com/checkout-step-two.html. No other WebElements but the Cancel button can be located on this page, regardless of the strategies and locators used. 

Note that on the E2E test case "PurchaseAllProductsAndCheckOrder" which does not follow the Page Object Model and Page Factory, the Finish button is successfully located, clickable and performs the expected function upon clicking.

Pending solution for this problem.
